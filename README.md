# Games Center
A website containing three games, Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4 and Checkers. All games can be played two player locally, singleplayer vs Ai or two player online.  
An instance of the website is currently running live at https://gamescenter.online.

To play either of the three games first create an account or login as a guest.
# Development
Games Center uses .NET 7.0 for the backend API with the front end developed using react as a framework. All the data is stored on a mysql database with entity framework core 7 acting as the database access framework or ORM. The live example of the website is run on docker using a docker image and served via nginx.
# What I Learned
* How to create a game Ai using the [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) Algorithm. Every game uses this algorithm to create the Ai, each of the difficulties have some slight adjustments to create separation between the difficulties.
* How to use React context.
* How to use Web Workers in javascript. Because the Ai sometimes takes a non negligible time to calculate the best move this task was better done in the background of the application so that it does not hang the ui.
* How to use Web Sockets. For the online mode web sockets were necessary to allow two way communication between the client and the server.
* How to create an online chat. Example of this in the online mode.
* Using exceptions to short circuit http requests.
* How to purchase a domain and use an official ssl certification.
